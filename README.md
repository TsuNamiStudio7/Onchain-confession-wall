Welcome to the **OnChain Confession Wall**, the place where your secrets stay safe, forever, on the Ethereum blockchain. Don't worryâ€”this wall won't judge you. But it will **immortalize** your deepest confessions. ðŸ”¥

## ðŸš¨ What is it?

**OnChain Confession Wall** is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to confess their secrets **anonymously** on the Ethereum blockchain. No one can delete or change your confession, and it stays there **forever**. Because who wouldnâ€™t want their embarrassing moments written in the stars (or at least on the blockchain)?

## âš¡ Features

- **Immutable**: Once on the blockchain, your confession stays there. Forever.
- **Anonymity**: No one can trace your confession back to you.
- **Confession History**: View and retrieve old confessions using their ID.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

1. **Confess** your secret with the `confess` function.
2. **Immutable** storage: Once a confession is made, it cannot be removed or altered.
3. **Check** the confession with the `getConfession` function by using its ID.
